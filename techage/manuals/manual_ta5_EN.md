# TA5: Future

Machines to overcome space and time, new sources of energy and other achievements shape your life.

Experience points are required for the manufacture and use of TA5 machines and blocks. These can only be worked out using the collider from TA4.

## Energy Sources

### TA5 Fusion Reactor

Nuclear fusion means the fusing of two atomic nuclei. Depending on the reaction, large amounts of energy can be released. Nuclear fusions, in which energy is released, take place in the form of chain reactions. They are the source of the energy of the stars, including our sun, for example. A fusion reactor converts the energy released during controlled nuclear fusion into electricity.

**How ​​do fusion reactors work?**

A fusion reactor works according to the classic principle of a thermal power plant: water is heated and drives a steam turbine, whose kinetic energy is converted into electricity by a generator.

A fusion power plant initially requires a large amount of energy, since a plasma has to be generated. "Plasma" is the name given to the fourth state of matter, after solid, liquid and gaseous. This requires a lot of electricity. Only through this extreme concentration of energy does the fusion reaction ignite and the heat given off is used to generate electricity via the heat exchanger. The generator then delivers 800 ku of electricity.

The plan on the right shows a section through the fusion reactor.

60 experience points are required to operate the fusion reactor. The fusion reactor must be built entirely in a forceload block area.

#### TA5 Fusion Reactor Magnet

A total of 60 TA5 Fusion Reactor Magnets are required to set up the fusion reactor. These form the ring in which the plasma forms. The TA5 Fusion Reactor Magnets requires power and has two ports for cooling.

There are two types of magnets, so all sides of the magnet that face the plasma ring can also be protected with a heat shield.

With the corner magnets on the inside of the ring, one connection side is covered (power or cooling) and can therefore not be connected. This is technically not feasible and therefore has no influence on the function of the fusion reactor.

#### TA5 Pump

The pump is required to fill the cooling circuit with isobutane. About 350 units of isobutane are required.

#### TA5 Heat Exchanger

The TA5 Heat Exchanger is required to convert the heat generated in the fusion reactor first to steam and then to electricity. The Heat Exchanger itself requires 5 ku electricity. The structure is similar to the Heat Exchanger of the energy store from TA4.

#### TA5 Fusion Reactor Controller

The fusion reactor is switched on via the TA5 Fusion Reactor Controller. The cooling/Heat Exchanger must be switched on first and then the controller. It takes about 2 minutes for the reactor to start up and supply electricity. The fusion reactor and thus the controller requires 400 ku of electricity to maintain the plasma.

#### TA5 Fusion Reactor Shell

The entire reactor must be surrounded by a shell that absorbs the enormous pressure that the magnets exert on the plasma and protects the environment from radiation. Without this shell, the reactor cannot be started. With the TechAge Trowel, power cables and cooling pipes of the fusion reactor can also be integrated into the shell.

#### TA5 Fusion Reactor Core

The core must sit in the center of the reactor. See illustration under "TA5 Fusion Reactor". The TechAge Trowel is also required for this.

## Energy Storage

### TA5 Hybrid Storage (planned)

## Logic blocks

## Transport and Traffic

### TA5 Flight Controller

The TA5 Flight Controller is similar to the TA4 Move Controller. In contrast to the TA4 Move Controller, several movements can be combined into one flight route. This flight route can be defined in the input field using several x,y,z entries (one movement per line). The flight route is checked and saved via "Save". In the event of an error, an error message is issued.

With the "Test" button, the flight route with the absolute coordinates is output for checking in the chat.

The maximum distance for the entire flight distance is 500 m.

The use of the TA5 Flight Controller requires 40 experience points.

### TA5 Hyperloop Chest

The TA5 Hyperloop Chest allows objects to be transported over a Hyperloop network.

The TA5 Hyperloop Chest has to be placed on a Hyperloop Junction. The chest has a special menu, with which you can pair two chests. Things that are in the chest are teleported to the remote station. The chest can also be filled/emptied with a pusher.

For pairing you first have to enter a name for the chest on one side, then you can select this name for the other chest and thus connect the two blocks.

The use of the TA5 Hyperloop Chest requires 20 experience points.

### TA5 Hyperloop Tank

The TA5 Hyperloop Tank allows liquids to be transported over a Hyperloop network.

The TA5 Hyperloop Tank has to be placed on a Hyperloop Junction.The tank has a special menu, with which you can pair two tanks. Liquids in the tank will be teleported to the remote station. The tank can also be filled/emptied with a pump.

For pairing you first have to enter a name for the tank on one side, then you can select this name for the other tank and thus connect the two blocks.

The use of the TA5 Hyperloop Tank requires 20 experience points.

## Teleport Blocks

Teleport blocks allow things to be transferred between two teleport blocks without the need for a pipe or tube in between. To pair the blocks, you first have to enter a name for the block on one side, then you can select this name for the other block and thus connect the two blocks. Pairing can only be carried out by one player (player name is checked) and must be completed before the server is restarted. Otherwise the pairing data will be lost.

The map on the right shows how the blocks can be used.

### TA5 Teleport Block Items

These teleport blocks allow the transfer of items and thus replace a tube. Distances of up to 200 blocks can be bridged.

Each Teleport blocks requires 12 ku of electricity.

60 experience points are required to use the teleport blocks.

### TA5 Teleport Block Liquids

These teleport blocks allow the transfer of liquids and thus replace a pipe. Distances of up to 200 blocks can be bridged.

### Hyperloop Teleport Blocks (planned)

The Hyperloop Teleport Blocks allow the construction of a Hyperloop network without Hyperloop tubes.

The use of the Hyperloop Teleport Blocks requires 120 experience points.



## More TA5 Blocks/Items

### TA5 Container (planned)

The TA5 container allows Techage systems to be packed and unpacked at another location.

80 experience points are required to use the TA5 container.

### TA5 AI Chip

The TA5 AI Chip is partly required for the production of TA5 blocks. The TA5 AI Chip can only be manufactured at the TA4 Electronics Fab. This requires 10 experience points.
