  "Tech Age is a technology mod with 5 development stages:\n"..
  "\n"..
  "TA1: Iron Age\n"..
  "Use tools and aids such as coal burners\\, coal burners\\, gravel sieves\\, hammers and hoppers to mine and process the necessary ores and metals.\n"..
  "\n"..
  "TA2: Steam Age\n"..
  "Build a steam engine with drive axles and use it to operate your first ore processing machines.\n"..
  "\n"..
  "TA3: Oil Age\n"..
  "Find and extract oil\\, built railways for oil transportation. A power plant provides the necessary electricity for your machines. Electric light illuminates your industrial plants.\n"..
  "\n"..
  "TA4: Present\n"..
  "Renewable energy sources such as wind\\, sun and biofuels help you to leave the oil age. With modern technologies and intelligent machines you set out into the future.\n"..
  "\n"..
  "TA5: Future\n"..
  "Machines to overcome space and time\\, new sources of energy and other achievements shape your life.\n"..
  "\n"..
  "Note: With a click on the plus sign you get into the subchapters of this manual.\n"..
  "\n"..
  "\n"..
  "\n",
  "This documentation is available both \"ingame\" (block construction plan) and on GitHub as MD files.\n"..
  "\n"..
  "  - Link: https://github.com/joe7575/techage/wiki\n"..
  "\n"..
  "The construction plans (diagrams) for the construction of the machines and the pictures are only available in-game.\n"..
  "\n"..
  "With Tech Age you have to start over. You can only create TA2 blocks with the items from TA1\\, for TA3 you need the results from TA2\\, etc.\n"..
  "\n"..
  "In TA2\\, the machines only run with drive axes.\n"..
  "\n"..
  "From TA3\\, the machines run on electricity and have a communication interface for remote control.\n"..
  "\n"..
  "TA4 adds more power sources\\, but also higher logistical challenges (power lines\\, item transport).\n"..
  "\n",
  "From V1.0 (07/17/2021) the following has changed:\n"..
  "\n"..
  "  - The algorithm for calculating the power distribution has changed. This makes energy storage systems more important. These compensate for fluctuations\\, which is important in larger networks with several generators.\n"..
  "  - For this reason TA2 got its own energy storage.\n"..
  "  - The battery blocks from TA3 also serve as energy storage. Their functionality has been adapted accordingly.\n"..
  "  - The TA4 storage system has been revised. The heat heat exchanger have been given a new number because the functionality has been moved from the lower to the middle block. If these were remotely controlled\\, the node number must be adapted. The generators no longer have their own menu\\, but are only switched on / off via the heat exchanger. The heat exchanger and generator must now be connected to the same network!\n"..
  "  - Several power grids can now be coupled via a TA4 transformer blocks.\n"..
  "  - A TA4 electricity meter block for sub-networks is also new.\n"..
  "  - At least one battery block or a storage system in each network\n"..
  "\n",
  "Many more blocks have received minor changes. It is therefore possible that machines or systems do not start up again immediately after the changeover. In the event of malfunctions\\, the following tips will help:\n"..
  "\n"..
  "  - Switch machines off and on again\n"..
  "  - remove a power cable block and put it back in place\n"..
  "  - remove the block completely and put it back in place\n"..
  "\n",
  "Techage adds some new items to the game:\n"..
  "\n"..
  "  - Meridium - an alloy for the production of luminous tools in TA1\n"..
  "  - Usmium - an ore that is mined in TA2 and needed for TA3\n"..
  "  - Baborium - a metal that is needed for recipes in TA3\n"..
  "  - Petroleum - is needed in TA3\n"..
  "  - Bauxite - an aluminum ore that is needed in TA4 to produce aluminum\n"..
  "  - Basalt - arises when water and lave touch\n"..
  "\n",
  "Meridium is an alloy of steel and mesecons crystals. Meridium ingots can be made with the coal burner from steel and mesecons crystals. Meridium glows in the dark. Tools made of Meridium also light up and are therefore very helpful in underground mining.\n"..
  "\n"..
  "\n"..
  "\n",
  "Usmium only occurs as nuggets and can only be obtained by washing gravel with the TA2/TA3 gravel washing system.\n"..
  "\n"..
  "\n"..
  "\n",
  "Baborium is only extracted in underground mining. Baborium can only be found in stone at an altitude between -250 and -340 meters.\n"..
  "Baborium can only be melted in the TA3 Industrial Furnace.\n"..
  "\n"..
  "\n"..
  "\n",
  "Petroleum can only be found with the help of the Explorer and extracted with the help of appropriate TA3 machines. See TA3.\n"..
  "\n"..
  "\n"..
  "\n",
  "Bauxite is only extracted in underground mining. Bauxite is only found in stone at a height between -50 and -500 meters.\n"..
  "It is required for the production of aluminum\\, which is mainly used in TA4.\n"..
  "\n"..
  "\n"..
  "\n",
  "Basalt is only created when lava and water come together.\n"..
  "The best thing to do is to set up a system where a lava and a water source flow together.\n"..
  "Basalt is formed where both liquids meet.\n"..
  "You can build an automated basalt generator with the Sign Bot.\n"..
  "\n"..
  "\n"..
  "\n",
  "  - 28.09.2019: Solar system added\n"..
  "  - 05.10.2019: Data on the solar system and description of the inverter and the power terminal changed\n"..
  "  - 18.11.2019: Chapter for ores\\, reactor\\, aluminum\\, silo\\, bauxite\\, furnace heating\\, gravel washing system added\n"..
  "  - 22.02.2020: corrections and chapters on the update\n"..
  "  - 29.02.2020: ICTA controller added and further corrections\n"..
  "  - 14.03.2020 Lua controller added and further corrections\n"..
  "  - 22.03.2020 More TA4 blocks added\n"..
  "\n",
  "TA1 is about mining sufficient ores and producing charcoal with simple tools and equipment\\, so that TA2 machines can be manufactured and operated.\n"..
  "\n"..
  "Of course\\, for an iron age there must also be iron and not just steel\\, as in \"Minetest Game\". As a result\\, some recipes have been changed so that iron has to be produced first and then steel later.\n"..
  "\n"..
  "The durability of the tools is based on the ages and therefore does not correspond to the original Minetest game.\n"..
  "The durability / hardness for an axe\\, for example:\n"..
  "\n"..
  "  - Bronze: 20\n"..
  "  - Steel: 30\n"..
  "\n"..
  "\n"..
  "\n",
  "You need the Charcoal Pile to make charcoal. Charcoal is required for the melting furnace\\, but also\\, for example\\, in TA2 for the steam engine.\n"..
  "\n"..
  "Building instructions (see also plan):\n"..
  "\n"..
  "  - Build a 5x5 area of ​​dirt\n"..
  "  - Place a lighter in the middle\n"..
  "  - Build a 3x3x3 cube above it out of wood\n"..
  "  - Cover everything with a layer of dirt to form a 5x5x5 cube\n"..
  "  - Leave a hole to the lighter\n"..
  "  - Light the lighter and immediately close the hole with a block of wood and dirt\n"..
  "  - If you have done everything correctly\\, the coal burner will start smoking after a few seconds\n"..
  "  - Only open the charcoal burner when the smoke has disappeared (approx. 20 min)\n"..
  "\n"..
  "Then you can remove the 9 charcoal blocks and refill the Charcoal Pile.\n"..
  "\n"..
  "\n"..
  "\n",
  "You need the melting furnace\\, for example\\, to melt iron and other ores in the melting pot. There are different recipes that require different temperatures. The higher the melting tower\\, the hotter the flame. A height of 11 blocks above the base plate is for all recipes\\, but a burner with this height also requires more charcoal.\n"..
  "\n"..
  "Building instructions (see also plan):\n"..
  "\n"..
  "  - Build a stone tower (cobble) with a 3x3 base (7-11 blocks high)\n"..
  "  - Leave a hole open on one side at the bottom\n"..
  "  - Put a lighter in it\n"..
  "  - Fill the tower with charcoal from the top to the top\n"..
  "  - Light the lighter through the hole\n"..
  "  - Place the melting pot in the flame over the tower\n(one block above the flame)\n"..
  "  - To stop the burner\\, temporarily close the hole with an dirt block\\, for example.\n"..
  "\n"..
  "The melting pot has its own menu of recipes and an inventory where you have to put the ores in.\n"..
  "\n"..
  "\n"..
  "\n",
  "The watermill can be used to grind wheat and other grains into flour and then bake them in the furnace to make bread. \n"..
  "The mill is powered by water power. To do this\\, a millrace must be led to the mill wheel via a canal.\n"..
  "The water flow and thus the mill wheel can be controlled via a sluice. The sluice consists of the sluice lock and sluice handle.\n"..
  "\n"..
  "The picture on the right (click on \"Plan\") shows the structure of the watermill. \n"..
  "\n"..
  "\n"..
  "\n",
  "The watermill can be used to grind wheat and other grains into flour and then bake them in the oven to make bread. The mill must be connected to the mill wheel with a TA1 axle. The power of the mill wheel is only enough for one mill.\n"..
  "\n"..
  "The mill can be automated with the help of a Minecart Hopper\\, so that the flour\\, for example\\, is transported directly from the mill into an furnace in order to bake bread from it.\n"..
  "\n"..
  "\n"..
  "\n",
  "The sluice gate valve must be placed directly next to a pond or in a stream at the same height as the water surface.\n"..
  "When the gate is opened\\, water flows through the slide. This water then has to be fed to the mill wheel\\, where it drives the mill.\n"..
  "\n"..
  "\n"..
  "\n",
  "The TA1 sluice handle must be placed on the sluice gate. The gate can be opened with the aid of the sluice handle (right click).\n"..
  "\n"..
  "\n"..
  "\n",
  "Block in different types of wood for building the millrace canal. However\\, any other material can also be used.\n"..
  "\n"..
  "\n"..
  "\n",
  "Block in different types of wood for building the millrace canal. This block is especially suitable in connection\n"..
  "with posts of the wooden fence to build a support of the canal.\n"..
  "\n"..
  "\n"..
  "\n",
  "TA1 has its own tools such as hammer and gravel sieve\\, but the Minecart Hopper can also be used.\n"..
  "\n"..
  "\n"..
  "\n",
  "The TA1 hammer can be used to knock/dig stone in a mine\\, but also to smash cobble to gravel. The hammer is available in different versions and therefore different properties: bronze\\, steel\\, brass and diamond.\n"..
  "\n"..
  "\n"..
  "\n",
  "Ores can be sifted from the gravel with the gravel sieve. To do this\\, click on the sieve with the gravel. The sifted gravel and ores fall out below.\n"..
  "\n"..
  "In order not to stand at the sieve for hours\\, sieving can be automated with the hopper.\n"..
  "\n"..
  "\n"..
  "\n",
  "The hopper from the \"Minecart\" mod is primarily used for loading and unloading Minecarts. He sucks in items from above and passes them on to the right. Therefore\\, when placing the hopper\\, pay attention to the direction of dispensing.\n"..
  "\n"..
  "The hopper can also pull items from boxes (chest)\\, provided the box is next to or on the hopper.\n"..
  "\n"..
  "The hopper can also put items in boxes if the box is next to the hopper.\n"..
  "\n"..
  "\n"..
  "\n",
  "With the help of two boxes\\, two hoppers and a gravel sieve\\, the sieving process can be automated. The plan on the right shows the structure.\n"..
  "\n"..
  "Make sure that the boxes are \"chest_locked\"\\, otherwise someone will steal the valuable ores from the box below.\n"..
  "\n"..
  "\n"..
  "\n",
  "TA1 has its own metal alloy meridium. Meridium ingots can be made with the coal burner from steel and mesecons crystals. Meridium glows in the dark. Tools made of Meridium also light up and are therefore very helpful in underground mining.\n"..
  "\n"..
  "\n"..
  "\n",
  "TA2 is about building and operating the first machines for processing ores. Some machines have to be driven via drive axles. To do this\\, you need to build a steam engine and heat it with coal or charcoal.\n"..
  "\n"..
  "In TA2 there is also a gravel rinser that can be used to wash out rare ores such as Usmium nuggets. You will need these nuggets later for further recipes.\n"..
  "\n"..
  "\n"..
  "\n",
  "The steam engine consists of several blocks and must be assembled as shown in the plan on the right. The blocks TA2 fire box\\, TA2 boiler top\\, TA2 boiler bottom\\, TA2 cylinder\\, TA2 flywheel and steam pipes are required.\n"..
  "\n"..
  "In addition\\, drive axles and gear blocks are required for changing direction. The flywheel must be connected to all machines that have to be driven via the drive axles.\n"..
  "\n"..
  "Always pay attention to the alignment of all blocks when placing:\n"..
  "\n"..
  "  - Cylinder on the left\\, flywheel on the right\n"..
  "  - Connect steam pipes where there is a corresponding hole\n"..
  "  - Drive axle on flywheel only on the right\n"..
  "  - In all machines\\, the drive axles can be connected on all sides\\, which is not occupied by other functions\\, such as the IN and OUT holes in the grinder and sieve.\n"..
  "\n"..
  "The boiler must be filled with water. Fill up to 10 buckets of water in the boiler.\n"..
  "The fire box must be filled with coal or charcoal.\n"..
  "When the water is hot (temperature display at the top)\\, the steam engine can be started on the flywheel.\n"..
  "\n"..
  "The steam engine has a capacity of 25 ku\\, so it can drive several machines at the same time.\n"..
  "\n"..
  "\n"..
  "\n",
  "Part of the steam engine.\n"..
  "\n"..
  "The fire box must be filled with coal or charcoal. The burning time depends on the power demanded by the steam engine. Coal burns for 32 s and charcoal for 96 s under full load.\n"..
  "\n"..
  "\n"..
  "\n",
  "Part of the steam engine. Must be filled with water. This is done by clicking on the boiler with a water bucket. When there is no more water or the temperature drops too low\\, the steam engine switches off.\n"..
  "\n"..
  "\n"..
  "\n",
  "Part of the steam engine.\n"..
  "\n"..
  "\n"..
  "\n",
  "Drive part of the steam engine. The flywheel must be connected to the machines via drive axles.\n"..
  "\n"..
  "\n"..
  "\n",
  "Part of the steam engine. The boiler must be connected to the cylinder via the steam pipes. The steam pipe has no branches\\, the maximum length is 12 m (blocks).\n"..
  "\n"..
  "\n"..
  "\n",
  "The drive axles are used to transmit power from the steam engine to other machines. The maximum length of a drive axis is 10 blocks. With TA2 Gearboxes\\, larger distances can be bridged\\, and branches and changes of direction can be realized.\n"..
  "\n"..
  "\n"..
  "\n",
  "The TA2 Power Generator is required to operate lamps or other power consumers on a steam engine. The TA2 Power Generator has to be connected to drive axles on one side and then supplies electricity on the other side.\n"..
  "\n"..
  "If the Power Generator is not supplied with sufficient power\\, it goes into an error state and must be reactivated with a right-click.\n"..
  "\n"..
  "The Power Generator takes max. 25 ku of axle power and provides on the other side max. 24 ku as electricity. So he consumes one ku for the conversion.\n"..
  "\n"..
  "\n"..
  "\n",
  "For larger systems with several steam engines or many driven machines\\, an energy storage system is recommended. The energy storage at TA2 works with position energy. For this purpose\\, ballast (stones\\, gravel\\, sand) is pulled up in a chest with the help of a cable winch. If there is excess energy in the axis network\\, the chest is pulled upwards. If more energy is required in the short term than the steam engine can supply\\, the energy store releases the stored energy again and the weight chest moves down again. \n"..
  "The energy storage consists of several blocks and must be assembled as shown in the plan on the right. \n"..
  "In order to achieve the maximum storage capacity\\, the chest must be completely filled with weights and the mast including the two gear boxes must be 12 blocks high. Smaller structures are also possible.\n"..
  "\n"..
  "\n"..
  "\n",
  "The cable winch must be connected to a gear box and can absorb excess energy and thus pull a weight chest upwards. The maximum rope length is 10 blocks. \n"..
  "\n"..
  "\n"..
  "\n",
  "This chest must be placed under the winch with a distance of up to 10 blocks and filled with cobblestone\\, gravel or sand. If the minimum weight of a stack (99+ items) is reached and there is excess energy\\, the box is automatically connected to the winch via a rope and pulled up. \n"..
  "\n"..
  "\n"..
  "\n",
  "In order to transport objects from one processing station to the next\\, pushers and tubes are used. See plan.\n"..
  "\n"..
  "\n"..
  "\n",
  "Two machines can be connected with the help of a pusher and a tube. Tubes have no branches. The maximum length is 200 m (blocks).\n"..
  "\n"..
  "Alternatively\\, tubes can be placed using the Shift key. This allows\\, for example\\, tubes to be laid in parallel without them accidentally connecting.\n"..
  "\n"..
  "The transport capacity of a tube is unlimited and only limited by the pusher.\n"..
  "\n"..
  "\n"..
  "\n",
  "Several tubes can be combined into one tube via the concentrator. The direction in which all items are passed on is marked with an arrow. \n"..
  "\n"..
  "\n"..
  "\n",
  "A pusher is able to pull items out of boxes or machines and push them into other boxes or machines. In other words\\, there must be one and exactly one pusher between two blocks with inventory. Multiple pushers in a row are not possible.\n"..
  "In the opposite direction\\, however\\, a pusher is permeable for items\\, so that a box can be filled via a tube and also taught.\n"..
  "\n"..

  "\n"..
  "  - Insulated cables (TA power cables) for local wiring in the floor or in buildings. These cables can be hidden in the wall or in the floor (can be \"plastered\" with the trowel).\n"..
  "  - Overland lines (TA power line) for outdoor cabling over long distances. These cables are protected and cannot be removed by other players.\n"..
  "\n"..
  "Several consumers\\, storage systems\\, and generators can be operated together in a power network. Networks can be set up with the help of the junction boxes.\n"..
  "If too little electricity is provided\\, consumers run out.\n"..
  "In this context\\, it is also important that the functionality of Forceload blocks is understood\\, because generators\\, for example\\, only supply electricity when the corresponding map block is loaded. This can be enforced with a forceload block.\n"..

  "In TA4 there is also a cable for the solar system.\n"..
  "\n"..
  "\n"..
  "\n",
  "Storage systems in the power grid fulfill two tasks:\n"..
  "\n"..
  "  - To cope with peaks in demand: All generators always deliver just as much power as is needed. However\\, if consumers are switched on/off or there are fluctuations in demand for other reasons\\, consumers can fail for a short time. To prevent this\\, there should always be at least one battery block in every network. This serves as a buffer and compensates for these fluctuations in the seconds range.\n"..
  "  - To store regenerative energy: Solar and wind are not available 24 hours a day. So that the power supply does not fail when no electricity is produced\\, one or more storage systems must be installed in the network. Alternatively\\, the gaps can also be bridged with oil/coal electricity.\n"..
  "\n"..
  "A storage system indicates its capacity in kud\\, i.e. ku per day. For example\\, a storage system with 100 kud delivers 100 ku for one game day\\, or 10 ku for 10 game days.\n"..
  "\n"..
  "All TA3/TA4 energy sources have adjustable charging characteristics. By default this is set to \"80% - 100%\". This means that when the storage system is 80% full\\, the output is reduced further and further until it switches off completely at 100%. If electricity is required in the network\\, 100% will never be reached\\, since the power of the generator has at some point dropped to the electricity demand in the network and the storage system is no longer charged\\, but only the consumers are served.\n"..
  "\n"..
  "This has several advantages:\n"..
  "\n"..
  "  - The charging characteristics are adjustable. This means\\, for example\\, that oil/coal energy sources can be reduced at 60% and regenerative energy sources only at 80%. This means that oil/coal is only burned if there are not enough renewable energy sources available.\n"..
  "  - Several energy sources can be operated in parallel and are loaded almost evenly\\, because all energy sources work\\, for example\\, up to 80% of the storage system's charging capacity at their full capacity and then reduce their capacity at the same time.\n"..
  "  - All storage systems in a network form a large buffer. The charging capacity and the filling level of the entire storage system can always be read in percent on every storage system\\, but also on the electricity terminal.\n"..
