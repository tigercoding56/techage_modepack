Minecart is based on carts, which is
based almost entirely on the mod boost_cart [1], which
itself is based on (and fully compatible with) the carts mod [2].

The model was originally designed by stujones11 [3] (CC-0).

Cart textures are based on original work from PixelBOX by Gambit (permissive
license).

Minecart Features
-----------------

The mod Minecart has its own cart (called Minecart) in addition to the standard cart.
Minecarts are used for automated item transport on private and public rail networks.
The mod features are:
- a fast cart for your railway or roller coaster (up to 8 m/s!)
- boost rails and speed limit signs
- rail junction switching with the 'right-left' walking keys
- configurable timetables and routes for Minecarts
- automated loading/unloading of Minecarts by means of a Minecart Hopper
- rail network protection based on protection blocks called Land Marks
- protection of minecarts and cargo
- Minecarts run through unloaded areas (only the stations/hopper have to be loaded)
- Extra Minecart privs for rail workers
- Ingame documentation (German and English), based on the mod "doc"
- API to register carts from other mods
- chat command '/mycart <num>' to output cart state and location


Technical Background
--------------------

The Minecart can "run" through unloaded areas. This is done by means of recorded 
and stored routes. If the area is unloaded the cart will simply follow the 
predefined route until an area is loaded again. In this case the cart will be 
spawned and run as usual.


Introduction
------------

1. Place your rails and build a route with two endpoints. Junctions are allowed 
   as long as each route has its own start and endpoint.
2. Place a Railway Buffer at both endpoints. (buffers are always needed, 
   they store the route and timing information)
3. Give both Railway Buffers unique station names, like Oxford and Cambridge
4. Place a Minecart at a buffer and give it a cart number (1..999)
5. Drive from buffer to buffer in both directions using the Minecart(!) to record the 
   routes (use 'right-left' keys to control the Minecart)
6. Punch the buffers to check the connection data (e.g. "Oxford: connected to Cambridge")
7. Optional: Configure the Minecart waiting time in both buffers. The Minecart
   will then start automatically after the configured time
8. Optional: Protect your rail network with the Protection Landmarks (one Landmark 
   at least every 16 nodes/meters)
9. Place a Minecart in front of the buffer and check whether it starts after the 
   configured time
10. Check the cart state via the chat command: /mycart <num>
    '<num>' is the cart number, or get a list of carts with /mycart
11. Drop items into the Minecart and punch the cart to start it, or "sneak+click" the 
    Minecart to get cart and items back
12. Dig the cart with 'sneak+click' (as usual). The items will be drop down.
13. To retrieve lost carts, use the chat command: /stopcart <num>

Hopper
------

![hopper](https://github.com/joe7575/minecart/blob/master/hopper.png)

The Hopper is used to load/unload Minecarts.
The Hopper can pull and push items into/out off chests and can drop/pick up items 
to/from Minecarts. To unload a Minecart place the hopper below the rail. 
To load the Minecart, place the hopper right next to the Minecart.


Cart Pusher
-----------

Used to push a cart if the cart does not stop directly at a buffer.
The block has to be placed below the rail.


Cart Speed / Speed Limit Signs
------------------------------

As before, the speed of the carts is also influenced by power rails.
Brake rails are irrelevant, the cart does not brake here.
The maximum speed is 8 m/s. This assumes a ratio of power rails
to normal rails of 1 to 4 on a flat section of rail. A rail section is a
series of rail nodes without a change of direction. After every curve / kink,
the speed for the next section of the route is newly determined,
taking into account the swing of the cart. This means that a cart can
roll over short rail sections without power rails.

In order to additionally brake the cart at certain points
(at switches or in front of a buffer), speed limit signs can be placed
on the track. With these signs the speed can be reduced to 4, 2, or 1 m / s.
The "No speed limit" sign can be used to remove the speed limit.

The speed limit signs must be placed next to the track so that they can
be read from the cart. This allows different speeds in each direction of travel.


Migration to v2
---------------

The way how carts are monitored and the cart speed is calculated has changed.
Therefore, it is necessary that all carts are repositioned and the
recording is repeated.
Rails and buffers are not affected and can be kept unchanged.
